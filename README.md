# Ipad Password Generator

My son loves to play with his iPad, so I decide to put some challenges before he can play his game.

* First week challenges: single digit addition.

  * I use Ruby language to create question sheet
    you can run the program with the following command:<br/>

    `$ruby ingle_digit.rb`

* Future development will include subtraction, multiplication and devision.
