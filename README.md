# Ipad Password Generator

My son loves to play with his iPad, so I decide to put some challenges before he can play his game.

* First week challenges: single digit addition.

  * I use Ruby language to create question sheet
    you can run the program with the following command:<br/>

    `$ruby ingle_digit.rb`

- Updates on 05/27/2018:

  * Write the questions on a txt file
  * First create a exercise folder with <br/>

    `$mkdir exercise`

  * Print out the page with system("lpr")
  * Enter the date and name of the child for your record
    (I choose not to print the name and date for the child so they can practice writing his/her own name)
  * Reference link is provided on the file
  * Run the program with following command:<br/>

    `$ruby create_write_file_practice.rb`

* Future development will include subtraction, multiplication and devision.
